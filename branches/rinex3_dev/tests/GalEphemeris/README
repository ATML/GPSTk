Introduction
________________________________________________________________________________

This is a basic program that runs through the process of adding a Galileo Nav
Message File to the GalEphemeris class and its corresponding classes.

The example nav message file was created from the GPS Nav Message File example
given in the RINEX 3.00 spec and has been modified to look like a Galileo
Nav Message File. []


Building
________________________________________________________________________________

A Makefile has been included.

Before building this test program, make sure that libgpstk-R3.a has been built.
This can be done by calling jam in the gpstk/branches/rinex3_dev/src directory.

Now, in order to build this test, simply run:

    sh$ make

This should give an executable, called main, that can be run.

If during the build process, make complains about missing source files or has
linking errors, check the Makefile's CFLAGS and LIBS variables to make sure that
the corresponding directories exist. []
    

Running
________________________________________________________________________________

To run this test, simple call the main application with a Nav Message File as a
parameter, like so:

    sh$ ./main RINEX3SpecGalExample.99N.R3

This will run the program and output a dump of the Nav Message File. []

Changelog

1/8/10:

    Moved tests to functions. Added simple input/output "test" where the output
    file should diff perfectly with the input file. See ../FunctionalTests.
